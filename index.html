				<p>One Piece (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda. It has
					been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 1997, with its individual
					chapters compiled in 107 tankōbon volumes as of November 2023. The story follows the adventures of Monkey D.
					Luffy and his crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, where he explores the Grand Line in search of the mythical treasure
					known as the "One Piece" in order to become the next King of the Pirates.

					The manga spawned a media franchise, having been adapted into a festival film by Production I.G, and an anime
					series by Toei Animation, which began broadcasting in 1999. Additionally, Toei has developed fourteen animated
					feature films, one original video animation, and thirteen television specials. Several companies have
					developed various types of merchandising and media, such as a trading card game and numerous video games. The
					manga series was licensed for an English language release in North America and the United Kingdom by Viz Media
					and in Australia by Madman Entertainment. The anime series was licensed by 4Kids Entertainment for an
					English-language release in North America in 2004 before the license was dropped and subsequently acquired by
					Funimation in 2007.

					One Piece has received praise for its storytelling, world-building, art, characterization, and humor. It has
					received many awards and is ranked by critics, reviewers, and readers as one of the best manga of all time. By
					December 2023, it had over 523.2 million copies in circulation in 61 countries and regions worldwide, making
					it the best-selling manga series in history, and the best-selling comic series printed in book volume. Several
					volumes of the manga have broken publishing records, including the highest initial print run of any book in
					Japan. In 2015 and 2022, One Piece set the Guinness World Record for "the most copies published for the same
					comic book series by a single author". It was the best-selling manga for eleven consecutive years from 2008 to
					2018, and is the only manga that had an initial print of volumes of above 3 million continuously for more than
					10 years, as well as the only that had achieved more than 1 million copies sold in all of its over 100
					published tankōbon volumes. One Piece is the only manga whose volumes have ranked first every year in Oricon's
					weekly comic chart existence since 2008.
